# ZDTool
Zendesk Tool for scraping and gaining details about tickets/correspondence from Zendesk case management system.

## Chrome Extension

The chrome extension is used after authentication into zendesk.  The button in the taskbar will allow for a user to scrape all the zendesk data into the backend application over https connection.  Therefore the connection to the backend server must have the certificate installed in chrome for the connection to work.

### Install

1. Zendesk/custom.js has environment variables that need to be setup at the top of the script.
2. Place Chrome into dev mode to allow addition of custom extensions
3. From `chrome://extensions/` click "Load Unpacked" button and select folder `chrome_extensions/Zendesk`.

## Backend

The backend of this application is used to save the zendesk information, as well as send the data out to a wavefront proxy.

### Required Dependencies

1. Mongodb instance running for the backend to connect with.
2. Certificates created and located in the root direction of the backend, which will be used in https communication.
  * `cert.key`
  * `cert.crt`
  
### Install

1. `npm install` from the root directory of the backend.
2. mongodb was hardcoded address `config.js`, this will need to be modified to current mongodb location.
3. wavefront proxy location was hardcoded and needs to be modified. `controller/wfQueue.js`.
4. sr stats application location was also hardcoded and needs to be modified `controller/srStats.js`.

There is a Dockerfile that can be used to build this into a docker container.  Future versions of this product would have certs and hardcoded addresses as environment variables.

## Operation

1. Start the backend `npm start` - backend will be running on port 4000.
2. Log into zendesk ticketing system
3. Click chrome extension for zendesk tool
4. Click Scrape button
